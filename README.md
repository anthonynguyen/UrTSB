UrTSB is a Game Server Browser for the FPS Urban Terror ( [http://www.urbanterror.info](http://www.urbanterror.info) ) targeted to run on Linux and Windows (Mac users: if you manage to get Python 2.6 and PyGTK running UrTSB should also work on MacOS).

### Features ###
 + server search (master server query)
 + filter results (including UrT specific gametypes)
 + display server details - players (with kills, ping) and server vars
 + manage favorites - add/remove servers to a favorites list
 + buddylist - manage a buddylist and search servers your buddies are playing on (note: the search is case sensitiv!). Supports substrings. For example if you add only the string [clantag] a buddysearch will return all servers where players with [clantag] in their name are playing. Good to see where your clanm8s are playing :)
 + of course launching Urban Terror with automatic connection to a selected server

 + RCON feature
