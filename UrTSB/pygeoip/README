Pure Python GeoIP API. The API is based off of MaxMind's C-based Python API [1],
but the code itself is based on the pure PHP5 API [2] by Jim Winstead and Hans Lellelid.

It is mostly a drop-in replacement, except the
`new` and `open` methods are gone. You should instantiate the GeoIP class yourself:

gi = GeoIP('/path/to/GeoIP.dat', pygeoip.MEMORY_CACHE)

The only supported flags are STANDARD, MMAP_CACHE, and MEMORY_CACHE

If you have any questions or find a bug, have a look at the project page [3] or
contact Jennifer Ennis <zaylea at gmail dot com>
